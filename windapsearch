windapsearch is a Python script to help enumerate users, groups and computers from a Windows domain through LDAP queries. 
By default, Windows Domain Controllers support basic LDAP operations through port 389/tcp. With any valid domain account (regardless of privileges), 
it is possible to perform LDAP queries against a domain controller for any AD related information.

If we have no user account credentials we could still enumerate anonymously the environment with windapsearch. 
Winapsearch has the ability to bind anonymously to the domain and enumerate active directory account credentials.

But since we have credentials, we are going to try both ways, without credentials and with credentials

See all the commands it has:
